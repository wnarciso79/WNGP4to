<p> Cancion: the search

"Hey, Nate, how's life?"
I don't know, it's alright
I've been dealin' with some things like every human being
And really didn't sleep much last night (last night)
"I'm sorry", that's fine
I just think I need a little me time
I just think I need a little free time
Little break from the shows and the bus rides (bus rides), yeah
Last year I had a breakdown
Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud
Had to see a therapist, then I found out
Somethin' funny's goin' on up in my house
Yeah, I started thinkin' maybe I should move out
You know, pack my cart, take a new route
Clean up my yard, get the noose out
Hang up my heart, let it air out (air out)
I've been searchin'
"What does that mean, Nate?"
I've been learning
</p>


<p> Cancion 2: imagine dragons
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way
That things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
</p>


<p> Cancion 3:idc :

I don't care 'bout anything, anything, anything
I don't care 'bout anything, but you
She calms me down when I'm mad
She makes me laugh when I'm sad
She always calls me right back, yeah, yeah, yeah
She wears her Vans with a dress
She's perfect when she's a mess
She makes me feel less depressed, yeah, yeah, yeah
She's cool, she's hot, she's pretty
The best part of the city
The rest is dark and shitty
But when you're laying with me
I don't care 'bout anything, anything, anything
I don't care 'bout anything, but you
I don't care 'bout anything, anything, anything
I don't care 'bout anything, but you
You know I do
